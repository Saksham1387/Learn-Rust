# Learn-Rust

Welcome to **Learn-Rust**! 🚀 This repository is my personal journey of learning Rust, a systems programming language that empowers developers to build reliable and efficient software.

Here, you'll find a collection of resources, tutorials, code snippets, and projects that I encounter and create as I explore the Rust ecosystem.

## 🦀 About Rust

Rust is a modern programming language that focuses on:
- **Memory Safety**: Rust eliminates null pointer dereferencing and data races at compile time.
- **Performance**: Comparable to C and C++, Rust is built for speed and low-level control.
- **Concurrency**: Easy-to-use features for safe parallelism.
